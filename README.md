## GA4GH Genomic Knowledge Standards

The "Genomic Knowledge Standards" ([GKS](http://ga4gh-gks.github.io)) work stream is one of the elements of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health ([GA4GH](http://ga4gh.org)), aimed at developing standard formats for the exchange of genomic data for research and biomedical applications.  All members of this team must follow the [GA4GH Standards of Professional Conduct]( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fQbKUuk_sfnzU0kTHU71KYF1suzzHoZVhBfao9Omsj0/edit).

The current focus of GKS lies in the evaluation and definitions of forward-looking formats and implementations for representation and annotation of genomic variants.

### Work Stream Leads:
- [Bob Freimuth](http://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/freimuth-robert-r-ph-d/bio-00027248)
- [Any Yates](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/people/andy-yates)

The two main projects are:

### [Variant Representation](https://ga4gh-gks.github.io/variant_representation.html)

_Standardised extensible model for computational variant representation_

Leads:
- [Larry Babb](https://www.clinicalgenome.org/about/people/staff/larry-babb/)
- [Michael Baudis](http://www.imls.uzh.ch/en/research/baudis.html)

### [Variant Annotation](https://ga4gh-gks.github.io/variant_annotation.html)

_Data model for linking variant data to annotations._

Leads:
- [Matt Brush](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/library/about/staff-directory/matthew-brush.cfm)
