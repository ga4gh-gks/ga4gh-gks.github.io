## GA4GH Genomic Knowledge Standards

The "Genomic Knowledge Standards" ([GKS](http://ga4gh-gks.github.io)) work stream is one of the elements of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health ([GA4GH](http://ga4gh.org)), aimed at developing standard formats for the exchange of genomic data for research and biomedical applications.  All members of this team must follow the [GA4GH Standards of Professional Conduct]( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fQbKUuk_sfnzU0kTHU71KYF1suzzHoZVhBfao9Omsj0/edit).

The current focus of GKS lies in the evaluation and definitions of forward-looking formats and implementations for representation and annotation of genomic variants.

### Work Stream Leads:
- [Bob Freimuth](http://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/freimuth-robert-r-ph-d/bio-00027248)
- [Andy Yates](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/people/andy-yates)

The two main projects are:
