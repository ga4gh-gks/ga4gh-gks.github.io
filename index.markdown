## GA4GH Genomic Knowledge Standards

The "Genomic Knowledge Standards" (GKS) work stream is one of the elements of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health ([GA4GH](http://ga4gh.org)), aimed at developing standard formats for the exchange of genomic data for research and biomedical applications. All members of this team must follow the [GA4GH Standards of Professional Conduct]( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fQbKUuk_sfnzU0kTHU71KYF1suzzHoZVhBfao9Omsj0/edit).

The current focus of GKS lies in the evaluation and definitions of forward-looking formats and implementations for representation and annotation of genomic variants.
